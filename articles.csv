While BJP hopes to placate sentiments at the hustings with its reservation policy, Congress continues to pick holes in the proposed matrix for Scheduled Castes .The cabinet recently decided to recommend to the Centre a division of the 17% reservation meant for SCs into smaller components to benefit various other communities. Under the new break-up, the state has recommended 6 per cent reservation for SC (Left), 5.5% for SC (Right), 4.5% for SC (Touchable), and 1% for SC (Others).  Congress MLA Priyank Kharge has accused the government of playing a dirty trick on Dalits by including Holaya, Holer and Holeya under Group 4 of internal categories that offers just one percentage of reservation. He said in north Karnataka districts, SCs belonging to the Left sect generally refer to their caste as SC Holeya, SC Holer and SC Holaya and not as SC Left or Right. This leaves room for confusion, given that they have been classified under Group 4, though they belong to Group 2. ""In such a scenario, they will be at a loss. They should have given thought to it before rushing through with the issue,"" Priyank said.Congress MLC Prakash K. Rathod also alleged that the decision is ""unconstitutional"". Lambani and Bhovi community members have staged protests demanding a revocation of the internal reservations. "
